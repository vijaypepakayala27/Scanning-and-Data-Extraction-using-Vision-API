# Scanning-and-Data-Extraction-using-Vision-API
This project uses Google Cloud Vision API to scan PDF and JPG documents (e.g., birth certificates, resumes, invoices) to extract text and create a data model for further analysis. It also includes bulk processing for multiple documents and visualization of the extracted data.
